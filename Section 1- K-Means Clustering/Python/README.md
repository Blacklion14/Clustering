# K-Means Clustering

## Definition

K-means clustering is a simple unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve clustering problems. It follows a simple procedure of classifying a given data set into a number of clusters, defined by the letter "k," which is fixed beforehand. The clusters are then positioned as points and all observations or data points are associated with the nearest cluster, computed, adjusted and then the process starts over using the new adjustments until a desired result is reached.

It is used whenever we need to fulfil following goals :

  - search engines, market segmentation, statistics and even astronomy. 

K-means clustering is a method used for clustering analysis, especially in data mining and statistics. It aims to partition a set of observations into a number of clusters (k), resulting in the partitioning of the data into Voronoi cells. It can be considered a method of finding out which group a certain object really belongs to.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail about customers of a Mall including their gender, age, anual income and Spending Score.
We try to find the relations between these variables by performing K-Means Clustering to predict which type of people spend more money in mall and what should be the target of advertisment and managemnet team of Mall.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
