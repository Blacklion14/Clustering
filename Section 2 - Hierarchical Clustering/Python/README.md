# Hierarchical Clustering

## Definition

Hierarchical clustering, also known as hierarchical cluster analysis, is an algorithm that groups similar objects into groups called clusters. The endpoint is a set of clusters, where each cluster is distinct from each other cluster, and the objects within each cluster are broadly similar to each other.

It is used whenever we need to fulfil following goals :

  - The most popular and widely used method to analyze social network data

The main output of Hierarchical Clustering is a dendrogram, which shows the hierarchical relationship between the clusters.

## Our Use Case

Here we are using a dataset containing detail about customers of a Mall including their gender, age, anual income and Spending Score.
We try to find the relations between these variables by performing K-Means Clustering to predict which type of people spend more money in mall and what should be the target of advertisment and managemnet team of Mall.

## Test Our Model

You can test our model by going to our Google Collab session and upload attached dataset in that session and run all cells to visualize the results.

## Results 

On running the Model you will see simillar results as shown below with our given dataset. If you wish to upload your own dataset you can rename and restructure that dataset as ours and upload it to session to view results.
